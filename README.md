# GPS

## STEP3 - GPS

Create data.csv file with nine components of your genotype. The first field is some 
arbitrary ID, the next nine fields are numbers (more on them later) and the last field is another 
arbitrary ID.

Then open R and run - 

~~~~~~
> source("GPS.r")
~~~~~~

You will see GPS_results.txt file bein created. 


Where does one get those nine numbers from? For that, you need to run admixture, as 
described below.
